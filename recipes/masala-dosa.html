    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <strong>First we will make the <em>dosa dough</em>...</strong>
      </p>
      <li>
        Put the rice in a bowl, rinse well and cover with 4 glasses of cold
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the lentils and fenugreek seeds in a small bowl, rinse well and add
        enough cold water to cover.
      </li>
      <li>Soak both for 4 to 6 hours.</li>
      <li>
        Drain the rice and lentil-fenugreek mixture in separate colanders.
      </li>
      <li>Put the rice in a food processor, blender or wet-dry grinder.</li>
      <li>Add 1 cup of cold water and make a smooth paste.</li>
      <li>
        It will take about 10 minutes and it may be necessary to work in groups.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat the process with the lentil-fenugreek mixture.</li>
      <li>Combine the two pastes in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together, adding enough water to make a medium-thick dough.You
        should get about 6 glasses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and place in a warm place.Allow to
        ferment for about 8 hours until the surface is bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix with salt. Use the dough immediately or refrigerate for later use.
      </li>
      <p>
        <strong>Next we will make the potato filling...</strong>
      </p>
      <li>Put vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        When the oil is rippling, add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds.Let the
        seeds pop for about 1 minute, then add the paprika and onion.
      </li>
      <li>Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, until the onions soften.</li>
      <li>
        Season lightly with salt. Add turmeric, asafetida, ginger, curry leaves,
        garlic, and green chile. Stir to coat and let sizzle for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add potatoes and 1/2 cup water. Cook, stirring well, for about 5
        minutes, until the liquid has evaporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mash the potatoes a little with the back of a wooden spoon. Season well
        with salt, add coriander, then set aside at room temperature.
      </li>
      <p>
        <strong>Finally, we can make the <em>dosas</em>...</strong>
      </p>
      <li>
        Set a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Brush with about 1
        teaspoon of vegetable oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle 1/4 cup batter in center of griddle. Using the bottom of the
        ladle, quickly spread the batter outward in a circular motion to a
        diameter of about 7 inches. Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon of oil on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly brown the dosa dough until the outside edges begin to look dry,
        about 2 minutes, cooking on one side only.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully loosen the dosa from the griddle with a spatula. The bottom
        should be crispy and nicely browned. Spoon 1/2 cup potato filling on top
        of the dosa, centering it in a strip in the middle of the round dosa.
        Flatten the potato mixture slightly. Using the spatula, fold the edges
        of the dosa around the filling to create a cylindrical shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        repeat from step 19 until you are satisfied with the number of dosas or
        you run out of dough.
      </li>
      <p><strong>...And your masala dosas are ready to serve</strong></p>
